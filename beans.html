        <h3 id="steps"> There are 10 steps before you can have your morning cup of 'Joe,' according to the NCAUSA.</h3>
        <p>&#9749;Step 1: Plant coffee beans, the “seed.”<br/></p>
        <p>&#9749;Step 2: Harvest the plant. Usually one large harvest per year, but each coffee tree will only produce viable fruit every 3-4 years. Coffee is a slow process. It tends to be picked by hand in a very laborious process.<br/><p>
        <p>&#9749;Step 3: Process the cherries. There are two ways – dry or wet. The dry method is the cheapest and has been traditionally used to ensure the cherries only hold 11% of their moisture. This process can take several weeks to do and is highly dependent on hot, dry weather. The second way, the wet method, requires more machinery. The machines remove the pulp from the cherries and then are separated by weight. Afterwards, the cherries are placed in fermentation tanks for 12 to 48 hours, depending on altitude and climate. The objective of this process to obtain a rough bean.<br/></p>

        <p>&#9749;Step 4: Beans are further dried. Often beans are sun-dried in the open.<br/></p>
        <p>&#9749;Step 5: Beans are milled through hulling machinery and/or polishing. In the hulling process, the dried husk is removed. Afterwards, the beans are inspected for size and color.<br/></p>
        <p>&#9749;Step 6: The coffee beans now look green and is the primary form in which they are exported.<br/></p>

        <p>&#9749;Step 7: Small batches of coffee are roasted and tested for their quality. The person doing the tasting is often referred to as the “cupper.”<br/></p>
        <p>&#9749;Step 8: Majority of the coffee is now roasted according to the cupper’s feedback. The green beans are roasted at about 550 degrees Fahrenheit. At this point, an oil emerges from the center of the bean and is called caffeol. In addition, the smell you are most familiar with coffee develops – the pyrolysis.<br/></p>
        <p>&#9749;Step 9: Coffee is ready to grind. Grinding levels vary based on the type of drink that is being made as well as the type of bean. Grounds for espresso beverages will always be finer than brewed coffee which requires a coarser grind.<br/></p>
        <p>&#9749;Step 10: Brew and sip.<br/></p>
